# func2matrix
This is a project that to change the function into a matrix like AX = B, the matrix can be used for the science calculation
1. Key in the function into the file function.txt
2. Key in the element of matrix X into matrixX.txt
3. Setting the code type of python, matlab or None for the output matrix.
4. Run the program and you can get the file MatrixA.txt
5. Copy the content of MatrixA.txt into your code, you don't need to write the matrix for several zero by yourself!
